    <p>
      PDF files are everywhere — contracts, reports, academic papers, e-books. But when you need to edit a PDF,
      the format works against you. That's where a free PDF to Word converter becomes essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toolify converts your PDF into a fully editable <strong>.docx file</strong> that opens in Microsoft Word,
      Google Docs, LibreOffice, and any other word processor. Unlike many tools that require you to hand over
      your email or create an account, Toolify asks for nothing. Just drop in your PDF and download your Word file.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Convert PDF to Word?</h2>
    <p>PDFs are designed for viewing, not editing. Here are the most common reasons people need a Word version:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Editing a contract or legal document</strong> — Add signatures, update clauses, or tweak terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Repurposing a report</strong> — Extract data or update statistics without retyping everything.</li>
      <li><strong>Updating a resume</strong> — Received a PDF template? Convert it to Word so you can personalise it.</li>
      <li><strong>Translating a document</strong> — Word files are easier to paste into translation tools.</li>
      <li><strong>Annotating academic papers</strong> — Add your own notes directly in the document.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Formatting is Preserved</h2>
    <p>
      A common frustration with PDF conversion is losing the original layout. Toolify's converter maps PDF
      text streams, font data, and structural markers to their Word equivalents. This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Headings, subheadings, and body text styles are retained</li>
      <li>Tables are reconstructed as actual Word tables (not images)</li>
      <li>Bold, italic, and underlined text is preserved</li>
      <li>Multi-column layouts are approximated where possible</li>
      <li>Embedded images remain in roughly the correct position</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note: PDFs with extremely complex designs — such as magazine layouts or heavily graphical brochures —
      may not convert perfectly. This is a known limitation of the PDF format itself, not just our tool.
    </p>

    <h2>Is It Safe to Convert PDFs Online?</h2>
    <p>
      With Toolify, yes. Your PDF is processed entirely inside your browser. Unlike other tools that upload
      your file to a remote server (where it could be stored, sold, or accessed by others), Toolify does everything
      locally. There is no server. There is no storage. The moment you close the tab, all traces of your file are gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is especially important for sensitive documents: tax returns, medical records, legal agreements,
      and business proposals. You should never upload these to an unknown server.
    </p>

    <h2>Tips for the Best Conversion Results</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Use text-based PDFs, not scanned images. If your PDF was created by a scanner, the text is actually an image and cannot be extracted without OCR.</li>
      <li>Avoid password-protected PDFs. Remove password protection before converting.</li>
      <li>For large documents, split them into sections first using our Compress PDF tool.</li>
      <li>After converting, review headings and numbering — these sometimes need minor cleanup in Word.</li>
    </ol>
